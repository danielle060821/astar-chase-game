🎮 A* Chase Game — Grid-Based Pursuit Game with Pygame

A small grid-based game built with Python and Pygame, featuring a player-controlled spaceship and an A* pathfinding agent(Alien) that dynamically chases the player.
The project explores pathfinding algorithms, dynamic enemy pursuit, real-time game logic, modular level design, UI design, and asset integration, including custom visuals and background music.

🚀 How to Run the Game
``` bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/danielle060821/astar-chase-game.git
cd astar-chase-game

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate venv (Mac/Linux)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install pygame

# Run the game
python game.py
```
🎮 How to Play
	•	Move the player (spaceship) using:
	•	W = up
	•	A = left
	•	S = down
	•	D = right

Objective
	•	Reach the goal flag before the A* alien agent catches you.

Game Rules
	•	The alien agent uses A* pathfinding to recalculate the shortest route toward the player in real time.
	•	Movement cooldowns ensure fair pacing between player and agent.
	•	A step counter tracks the agent’s movement cost.
	•	The game displays a countdown intro, win/lose states, and end-game delay before exit.

🧠 Technical Highlights
	•	A* pathfinding implemented from scratch with:
	•	Open set (priority queue)
	•	Closed set
	•	g_score, f_score, and path reconstruction
	•	Real-time agent pursuit with dynamic path recomputation
	•	Grid-based collision and movement constraints
	•	Modular game structure (separate logic for grid, agent, and game state)
	•	Custom UI and assets:
	•	Player spaceship sprite
	•	Alien enemy sprite
	•	Goal flag icon
	•	Integrated background music (composed and edited by the developer)
	•	Relative asset paths for portability across environments
	•	Virtual environment workflow for clean dependency management

📌 Notes
	•	Designed as a playable demo rather than a full commercial game.
	•	The project focuses on algorithmic correctness, system structure, and interactive behavior rather than visual polish.
	•	Future extensions could include multi-level maps, teleport mechanics, or learning-based agents.
